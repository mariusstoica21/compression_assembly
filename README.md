# Compression - Assembly x86 and Delphi

A desktop application that compresses an input text and creates a dictionary based on the compression.

The user can write an input text, for example, "Ana has apples. George has apples." and the app wil compress the text into "0 1 2. 3 1 2.", a smaller string. 
The app will also display the dictionary created, based on the input text and the compression result (0 - ana, 1 - has, 2 - apples, 3 - george).

The desktop app was created in Delphi, while the compression app was developed in assembly x86. In the desktop application, when the user presses the 'Start'
button in order to compress the input text, the desktop app will run "compresssion_asm.exe", which will compress the input text into the smaller string.

The project consists of two main components:
- Assembly x86 component
- Delphi component
